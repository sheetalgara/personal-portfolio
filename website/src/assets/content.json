In an enterprise that gives importance to DevOps culture, Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) takes responsibility to meet server-level objectives by using SLIs.\n\nHere I worked on a project to build key indicators of different features. We implemented this using TIG Stack (Telegraph Influx Grafana) where we used the stats plugin to get the metric data & store time-series data in InfluxDb. Visualization of this huge data to give meaningful insights was a challenge. \n\nThe picture here gives a snapshot of the visualization we have built to achieve this. We also built alerts around this visualization to resolve production issues as soon as they occur. \n\nTools : Python, Flask, Telegraf, InfluxDb, Grafana "

        "text": "Description : \n\nThis project explains how to reconstruct a 3D image using projection data and perform operations on reconstructed objects. Computed Tomography reconstruction is a technique where a series of slices or individual images within a body are stacked and correlated with each other to create a meaningful image. When a 2D projection slices through the object, we then get a set of 1D parallel projections. The most commonly used reconstruction algorithm is the filtered back-projection method.\n\nI began with 2D projection images and developed them in photoshop. Using the Computer Tomography Reconstruction Module available in VG Studio Max allows projection images to be imported directly from a CT system. The module converts projection images into volume data based on the Feldkamp algorithm. It also improves image quality using the standard Volume Graphics bear hardening correction. \n\nTools : VG Studio Max 2.2, Image Processing, Photoshop, 2D Projections\n"
